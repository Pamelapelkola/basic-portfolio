    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I currently work seasonally for Washington County Park systems.  I enjoy the outdoors as much
        as I enjoy technology.  I spent 17 years in the banking industry as a back office support specialist
        working closely with global markets and also assisted in database administration. I found I had more of a connection
        with what was happening with the IT group than with banking so I recently went back to school at the University of
        Minnesota's coding bootcamp to learn skills necassary to compete in this ever changing field.

        When I'm not learning new technologies, I am spending time with my husband and our 3 children.  We enjoy baseball
        and our spring and summer are spent on bleachers cheering on our locl team the Minnesota Twins and our children 
        love to play this sport. 

        Web Development is a fast growing, dynamic field and I am looking forward to using my new skillset and my perceptive, 
        driven,and deliberate stlye to be an asset to the company I'd work for.
