        <p> I currently work seasonally for Washington County Park systems.  I enjoy the outdoors as much as I enjoy technology.  
        I spent 17 years in the banking industry as a back office support specialist working in the global markets, however 
        much of my time was spent assisting in database management and administration. I found I had a strong connection with 
        the IT group and I found that work was more interesting than my banking position so I went to the University of 
        Minnesota's coding bootcamp to learn skills necassary to compete in this dynamic field.
        </p>
        <p>
        When I'm not learning new technologies, I am spending time with my husband and our 3 children.  We enjoy baseball
        and our spring and summer are spent cheering on our local team the Minnesota Twins and sitting in the bleachers cheering 
        on our children who love to play this sport. 

        Web Development is a fast growing field and I am looking forward to using my new skillset and my perceptive, 
        driven,and deliberate stlye to be an asset to the company I work for.
        </p>
